# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel really confident! I've worked with lists in python before, so this isn't super new. There's definitely still room for growth as far as getting comfortable working with specific array methods in ruby, but I feel great about the general concept.

- Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I don't think so. I know we'll build off of arrays a lot in iteration, so I'm excited to dig my hands in and learn some more.

- What questions do you have about Arrays?

In python, you can create empty arrays (lists) and then write code to fill them. Can they work the same way in ruby? And do the uses of arrays in ruby differ from the uses of lists in python?
